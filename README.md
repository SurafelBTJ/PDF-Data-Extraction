# PDF Data Extraction

This repo is about extracting several PDF files that capture all past ranking of professional golf players from World Golf Ranking website. The scrip scrapes all tables from the PDF excluding the header, footers or any other logo images then the tables will be saved in CSV format.

The script is parametrized so that the user can specify how many years of data wants to retreive. Once done that, then the path to the destination folder can be customized, where the CSV files will be written to.
